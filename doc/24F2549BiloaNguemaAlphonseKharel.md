# Progress Report – C Programming Exercises

## 1. Matrix × Vector Product

Goal:
Compute \( R = T \times V \), where \( T \) is a matrix and \( V \) is a vector.

Challenges:  
- Incorrect indexing (starting at 1 instead of 0).  
- Handling matrix dimensions.  
- Output formatting issue (extra comma at the end).

Progress Made:  
- Corrected indexing.  
- Added validation of dimensions using do…while.  
- Improved output formatting.

## 2. Cross Product (u × v)

Goal:  
Compute \( u \times v \) for two 3D vectors.

Challenges:  
- Memorizing the cross product formula.  
- Handling the difference between array indices (0-based) and user-friendly display.

Progress Made:  
- Correct application of the cross product formula.  
- Clear display of the result.

## 3. Summary

- Gained good control over loops and arrays in C.  
- Improved understanding of indexing and matrix-related computations.  

Next Steps:  
- Create functions to better organize the code.  
- Add user input validation for robustness.
